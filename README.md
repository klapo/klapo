## About me

My work focuses on building tools suited towards the complexities of multi-scale data, especially the large and spatially-complex data typical of geosciences. I love creating interpretable and physical solutions for complex problems. 

### Who I work with
Active collaborations with:
- University of Innsbruck [Turbulence Group](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/acinn/research/atmospheric-turbulence/)
- The [AI Institute](https://dynamicsai.org/) at the University of Washington
- The [Allen Turing Institue](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)

### Current Work

Currently working on these projects:
- [PyDMD](https://github.com/PyDMD/PyDMD)
- [SINDy-SHRED](https://github.com/klapo/sindy-shred/tree/shufflin)
- Some secret projects related to time series forecasting and systems identification for multi-scale systems. Curious? Contact me at: karl-eric.lapo _ uibk.ac.at
