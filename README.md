### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoc on the [ERC DarkMix project](http://www.bayceer.uni-bayreuth.de/meteo/de/erc1/gru/html.php?id_obj=139240). My work focuses on building the software infrastructure and analytic techniques for the large and spatially-complex data from Distributed Temperature Sensing. Most of time on github focuses on the pyfocs library.
